** Project Ideas
*** Learn how to look up documentation in haskell - offline docs
*** Write some thing to show documentation at point in haskellrsion fo

*** Implementing Scheme in Haskell 48 hrs
*** Port GNU Go to Haskell
*** Do CS 131 projects in haskell
*** Parsing Genome Data and doing statistical stuff on it
*** Output 3d chemical objects from chemical spectra.
*** Life is a playground where learning is endless.
*** Replace  wicd with haskell
*** Can you write pong and or spacewars in haskell ? If it is such a great platform it should not be hard
*** Try to start with baby steps
*** A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
*** Create a list of programming gotchas
*** Create a Video Tutorial of haskell which goes over a couple of haskell books (some how video tutorials are better)
**** Real World Haskell
**** Haskell Tutorial 98
**** Introduction To Functional Programming
*** Improve haskell/ide support?
** Quesitons
*** What is the performance effects consequences of haskell
*** God GC! Pointers to thunks - darcs -> git
*** Strictness flags and laziness -> crash and burn haskell
*** Tablet based handwriting recognition is a good thing to have. Even if it is user subjugating
*** Distinguishing evils is important (You need to balance the lesser of two evils)
*** Stallman is not able to balance lesser of two evils. For him evil is evil no matter what.
*** i.e Evil taint is enough -
*** Shouldnt software reach some threshold of importance before it must be given up for free.
*** Porting awk to haskell will mean you can call it hawk
** Notes
*** Being able to create list of imperative actions and then sequence them is quite interesting and powerful -- is it equivalent to macros ?
*** Haskell has a lot of warts that make it easy for beginners to stumble badly , python should still be a beginners first language.
*** Where as the type system should be something which should be reason about your program
*** and tell you lots of things about it , ala quickcheck in haskell the lack of tools is quite obvious. May be this is simply a reflection of the immaturity of the languate.
*** Haskell makes it so easy to write inefficient code it is ridiculous.
*** C it is crystal clear what your code is doing where as  haskell it may be copying , garbage collecting to high heaven.
*** One thing is clear though you will be be able to write "imperative code whether you like it or not" so it might be a good language to discipline yourself in.
*** is it just me or putStrLn works differently inside ghc vs ghci
*** I like how emacs help system is integrated right into the way that elisp is defined. wish haskell could do something similar.
*** I wish one there was someone who wrote some version of haskell shell the same way someone has written a bash shell spase syntax makes it a powerful env.

** MetaNotes
*** If you can call haskell process with functions and buffer regions then it can be super useful for you
*** Ask on #haskell  if emacs mode is sufficient.
*** 
*** Sharing code prompts valuable discussions needed for having a cumalative effect and starting conversation in the public sphere see habermas.
*** code is a form of speech.
*** See ways to integrate emacs with haskell
